Ben.

That’s a real nice web page you made. Welcome to LOGICnow. We have many web pages (some even look a little bit like yours!); we are what is called a 'web presence'. Would you like to join us? Or do you want to continue to fuck off wasting 15-minute chunks of time building My First Web Page using templates and forms our development team built for a completely different use case?

Ben, do you know what a False Equivalency is? It’s when someone says something like, "I copy-pasted some unformatted content into a template and clicked the Approve button; by this metric, the PPC web dev team could produce four PPC trial pages per hour." The false equivalency stems from the mistaken belief that PPC trial pages are created using the same process. I only choose this example because it’s obvious even to a slow child that this is a false assumption. Forgive my hyperbole.

Ben, I want to thank you for offering the use of the web page you worked so hard on. Most people would consider it unreasonable, or possibly even snide, to offer assistance to the team that built the template, in case they needed help using the template. But not you, Ben. And I want to make sure we all step back and appreciate the kind of guy you must be, one who doesn’t assume the person who creates a tool knows how and when to use that tool. You really are a special thinker, Ben.

I just wanted to give you a quick heads-up on one thing, though, Ben. There was this odd tone that sort of crept into your email, sort of like you think you might be trying to shame or blame some other team members. We’re not scared of you, Ben. We were running successful PPC campaigns using hard data long before we bought up your little company and its sideshow of a product. Grow up, Ben. This is a real business, and you sound like a fool. 

Yours,

The "web dev team"
